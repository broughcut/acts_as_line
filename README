ActsAsLine
==========

Early days.


Example
=======

object = Foo.find(:first)

results = Foo.touching(object) | results = Foo.intersects(object,true)
results = Foo.asunder(object) | results = Foo.intersects(object,false)

results = Foo.touching(object,{:id => 123})
results = Foo.touching(object,{:id => '>123'})
results = Foo.touching(object,{:id => '<>123'}) etc
results = Foo.touching(object,{:id => 123, :title => 'bar'})

requires a geom field on acts_as_line model... migration to come.
